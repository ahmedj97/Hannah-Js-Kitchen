                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>When I hear "Club Sandwich", this is not quite what I think of. That is why I titled this "Desi" Club Sandwich to make it less confusing for those of us who are used to the American version. This is similar to the Club Sandwich that I know, but with a few twists and, of course, more seasoning. My husband and I have been known to pack this up with a few snacks and bring it to the pool on the weekend. <br> <br> 

                    This sandwich has everything you need in a meal. Protein, dairy, lots of flavor, veggies to refresh you, and lots of bread. (I love bread). Whether or not you have tried this type of club sandwich before, I am excited for you to try this delicious recipe!</p>

                    <p> Serving Size: 2 <br>
                        Time: 25 min </p>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by removing the crust from the slices of bread and lightly toasting them. I like to use the sandwich cut bread because it is thinner and there will be a full 3 layers of bread.</li>
                    <li>In a bowl, crack the 2 eggs and add 1 tsp of milk and some salt and pepper to taste. The milk will help the eggs to get super fluffy. Whisk them well and then add them to a medium, oiled pan on medium low heat and cover the pan. You will cook these omelet style. Be sure to keep an eye on them and remove from heat as soon as they are cooked through. Over cooking can lead to dry eggs that stick to the pan.</li>
                    <li>Next you will take out a cutting board and cut your chicken into small, pea-sized pieces. It will almost be like largely ground chicken. Add the cut chicken to a bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li> To the bowl of chicken, add 2 tbsps of Tandoori masala, salt, pepper, and chili powder to taste. Mix well. The chili powder will determine the spice level so proceed with caution. For the Tikka masala, I use Shan seasoning boxes. These can be found at almost any desi grocery store. You can also make your own seasoning with whatever spices sound good to you!</li>
                    <li>Add 1 tsp of oil to a separate pan on medium heat and add the seasoned chicken. Cover until chicken is cooked, which should only take 5-7 minutes. Add sliced cheese on top for the last 2 minutes so it can melt and then remove from heat. Make sure to cover it during this time as well so it can melt.</li>
                    <li> While the chicken is cooking, cut a few slices of tomato and cucumber. I usually just do 2 slices of each per sandwich. A lot of people also add a layer of lettuce here. You can really have fun and customize it with whatever veggies you want!</li>
                    <li> Spread a layer of mayonnaise on each slice of toast, putting it on both sides of 2 of the pieces (these are your middle pieces).</li>
                    <li>Put 2 pieces of toast on top of the cooked eggs. You will use this as a template to make your eggs the exact size of your sandwich. Use a knife and gently trace the toast to cut out your egg pieces. </li>
                    <li>Now it is time for the fun part - assembling your sandwiches! Put it together in this order: bottom toast, chicken with melted cheese, middle toast, egg, veggies, and top toast</li>
