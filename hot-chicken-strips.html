                    <p>These Hot Chicken Strips are the BEST, quick and easy lunch. And they're HEALTHY!?! Seems too good to be true... but it's true. I have perfected the sauce to have just the perfect amount of spice, flavor, sweetness and zest. The honey balances out the heat from the hot sauce. The garlic and paprika bring the buffalo flavor a new life. The hint of lemon will have you craving more. Go ahead, makes these delicious strips and see for yourself!</p>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by spraying your air fryer with non stick spray. Set it to "Air Crisp" or "Air Fry", depending on what air fryer you have, and put the temperature to 350F.</li>
                    <li>Cut up you chicken breast into strips. I like to do them about 2 inches wide and only about 1/2 inch thin. You may need to use a meat mallet to make them thinner, depending on how you are cutting them.</li>
                    <li>Grab a bowl and add 2 Tbsps Frank's sauce, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Stir it up.</li>
                    <li> Add your chicken strips to the bowl and mix them until they are fully covered in your sauce.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 cups of corn flakes to a large plate or container and crush them. You may even want to crush them in a ziploc bag before adding them to the plate for less mess. They do not need to be fully crushed. Some larger pieces should remain.</li>
                    <li>  Take your chicken strips one by one from the sauce and press them into your crushed corn flakes. Flip to get both sides covered.</li>
                    <li> Add these chicken strips to your air fryer and set the time to 10 minutes. If they cook for any longer, the corn flakes will start to burn. </li>
                    <li>In a new bowl, add 1/2 cup of Frank's sauce, 2 Tbsps of honey, and 1 tsp of fresh lemon juice. Stir to mix. </li>
                    <li>Once your chicken is done in the air fryer, move it onto a small plate. One by one, dip your chicken strips in the sauce, flipping to fully cover them. Do this gently so that the corn flakes do not come off. After dipping, add them to your plate and get ready to eat!</li>
