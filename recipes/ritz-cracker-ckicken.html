                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>This Ritz Cracker Chicken is on my list of favorite meals. It is so easy to make and SO yummy, you will be going back for seconds. It's also just fun to make dinner out of crackers. And the gravy. THE GRAVY. It is just so, so good. It is the perfect pair for the chicken and has a delicious, creamy, chickeny taste. Whenever my husband wants this for dinner he just says, "Hey can you make that chicken with that white sauce?". 
                        <br><br>
                    You absolutely HAVE to pair this chicken with my super easy Parmesan Noodles on the side. I'm pretty sure it's a law. I'm just the messenger. So go ahead and get yourself some ritz crackers, if you don't have some already, and whip this up for a new family go-to dinner!

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <h3> For the Chicken </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Crush 1.5 sleeves of Ritz crackers into big crumbs (can use a food processor or by hand) and spread onto a large plate.
                    </li>
                    <li>Crack the 2 eggs into a bowl and whisk.</li>
                    <li>Heat a large pan on the stove on medium heat and add 2 Tbsps of salted butter and 2 Tbsps of oil.</li>
                    <li> Cut the 4 chicken breasts into a few pieces (about 3 per breast). You may want to flatten the thicker parts to make them more even.</li>
                    <li>Dip the chicken pieces into the egg mixture, and then into the Ritz, pressing each side firmly into the crumbs. Set each piece aside until they are all ready.</li>
                    <li>  Make sure the oil and butter are well mixed in the pan and add the chicken. Make sure the pieces are not touching if possible. You may need to do 2 batches. </li>
                    <li> Cook until golden, about 5-7 minutes per side. </li>
                   
                </ol>





                <h3> For the Gravy </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set a medium pan on medium-low heat and add 1/2 a cup half and half, 2 Tbsps butter, and salt and pepper to taste. Crumble in the 1.5 chicken bouillon cubes. Stir regularly.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, add 1 cup of milk, 2 Tbsps flour, and 2 Tbsps corn starch. Use a fork and mix it until no clumps remain.</li>
                    <li>Slowly pour the mixture into the pan, stirring as you go.</li>
                    <li> Leave on heat, stirring regularly, until the sauce begins to thicken. Remove from heat and cover until ready to eat.</li>
